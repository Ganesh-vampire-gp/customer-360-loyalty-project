Example As-Is (text):

Customer raises query via email/WhatsApp → Agent opens separate systems (email system, order system) → agent manually searches order → logs case in ticketing tool → agent replies → no loyalty context available.

Example To-Be (text):

Customer message arrives via WhatsApp → Platform ingests message into Salesforce → Omni-Channel routes to Agent Anjali → Agent sees 360 view (orders, loyalty) in Service Console → Agent resolves quickly → loyalty points awarded automatically on order activation.
